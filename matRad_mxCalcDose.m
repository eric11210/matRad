function d = matRad_mxCalcDose(dij,w,cst)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% matrix based dose calculation and for biological base data also RBE,
% alpha, effect, etc.
% 
% call
%   d = matRad_mxCalcDose(dij,w)
%
% input
%   dij:    dose influence matrix
%   w:      bixel weight vector
%   cst:    matRad cst struct
%
% output
%   d:      struct containing the dose cube. If alpha and beta cubes are 
%           also available, rbe cube, RBE-weighted dose etc. will also be
%           calculated
